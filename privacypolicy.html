				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p><em>Effective and Last Updated: Janury 15, 2011</em></p>
				<p>DesignSceneApp.com and the DesignScene iPad app is produced by <strong>Lunar/Theory</strong>. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact with the content, products and services on this site (the “Site”) and the iPad app (the “App”). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and App only. It does not apply to other websites to which we link. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree that your use of the Site and the App signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site nor the App.</p>
				<h3>Information Collected</h3>
				<p>When you use our Site or App, you do so anonymously. Personal information—including your e-mail address—is not collected. We only collect one type of information from you that is derived through automated tracking mechanisms.</p>
				<p>Our Site and App may use “cookies” and other tracking technologies. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user's system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.</p>
				<p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.</p>
				<p>Our Site and App may employ technologies to track your usage, such as your IP address and the links you click on.</p>

We use your personally identifiable information to support and enhance your use of the Site and App and their features.</p>
				<p>The Site and App may use your personal information for target advertising toward you based on things such as region, gender, interests, goals, habits, etc.</p>
				<p>We may permit certain trusted third parties to track usage, analyze data such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. This is collected in order to better understand our Web site usage, and enhance the performance of services to maintain and operate the Site and App and certain features on the Site and App. We may use third parties to host the Site; operate various features available on the Site and App; send emails; analyze data; provide search results and links and assist in fulfilling your orders.</p>

				<p>Lunar/Theory may disclose Contact Information in special cases where we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our terms and conditions of use or may be causing injury or interference with our rights, property, our customers or anyone who could be harmed by such activities.</p>
				<p>You will receive notice when your personally identifiable information might be provided to any third party for any reason other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you will have an opportunity to request that we not share such information.</p>

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information and data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
