				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p><em>Effective and Last Updated: October 1, 2010</em></p>
				<p>DesignSceneApp.com and the DesignScene iPad app is produced by <strong>Lunar/Theory</strong>. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact with the content, products and services on this site (the “Site”) and the iPad app (the “App”). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and App only. It does not apply to other websites to which we link. Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure of it. You agree that your use of the Site and the App signifies your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site nor the App.</p>
				<h3>Information Collected</h3>
				<p>When you use our Site or App, you do so anonymously. Personal information—including your e-mail address—is not collected. We only collect one type of information from you that is derived through automated tracking mechanisms.</p>
				<p>Our Site and App may use “cookies” and other tracking technologies. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. If a user's system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.</p>
				<p>You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.</p>
				<p>Our Site and App may employ technologies to track your usage, such as your IP address and the links you click on.</p>
